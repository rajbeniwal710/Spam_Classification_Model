NLP based Spam Classification Model

Natural Language processing is a field concerned with the ability of the computer to understand, analyze, manipulate, and potentially generate human language. NLP encompasses many topics like:
1. Sentiment Analysis
2. Topic Modelling
3. Text Classification
4. Sentence Segmentation or part-of-speech tagging

This was a learning project and I have tried to implement several Natural Language Processing techniques to build an spam classification model.
